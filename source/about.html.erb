<h1>We are a global public health initiative with one mission: save lives</h1>

<p class="intro">Resolve to Save Lives helps governments and civil society implement scalable, proven strategies.</p>

<p>We are determined to prevent millions of deaths from cardiovascular disease and epidemics, with a focus on accelerating action through speed, simplicity, and scale in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

<p>Resolve to Save Lives is an initiative of the global public health organization <a href="http://www.vitalstrategies.org">Vital Strategies</a>. We received $225 million from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/">Bloomberg Philanthropies</a>, the <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, and Gates Philanthropy Partners, which is funded with support from the <a href="http://czi.org">Chan Zuckerberg Foundation</a>.</p>
