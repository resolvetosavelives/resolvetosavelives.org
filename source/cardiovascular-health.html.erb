<h1>Save 100 million lives from cardiovascular disease</h1>

<p class="intro">Everyone knows someone who has died from cardiovascular disease. Heart attacks and strokes are so common that they seem like just a regular part of modern life. But it doesn't have to be that way.</p>

<p>Proven, scalable solutions exist, and they're affordable. If these solutions are applied broadly, 100 million lives can be saved in the next 30 years.</p>

<h2>How to save 100 million lives</h2>
<p>The majority of deaths from cardiovascular disease are in low- and middle-income countries, so that's where we focus our attention.</p>

        <p><strong><span class="drop">Solution 1</span><br>Improve global control of blood pressure from 14% to 50%.</strong> Only about 1 in 7 people (14%) in the world has their blood pressure under control.

<h2>How we work </h2>
<p>We work closely with partners, governments and civil society to help countries improve the heart health of their citizens. We work directly with countries, or through our partners, to fund and develop customized cardiovascular disease prevention programs based on the most recent evidence-based practices.</p>
<p>Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> if you would like to discuss how we could work together to improve cardiovascular health in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
