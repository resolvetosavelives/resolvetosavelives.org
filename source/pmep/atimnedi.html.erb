<h3>Quote</h3>
<blockquote>&ldquo;The anthrax outbreak in wildlife with spill-over to livestock and humans in Uganda in 2004-2005 was both an eye opener and a motivator for me. At a personal, institutional and national level we learned the need to better prepare for epidemics before hand and the multi-stakeholder/multi-agency engagement needed in epidemic preparednes and response.&rdquo;</blockquote>
