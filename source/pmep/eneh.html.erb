<h3>Quote</h3>
<blockquote>&ldquo;Epidemic occurrence is inevitable due to environmental changes. I feel motivated to encourage investment in epidemic preparedness as it is more beneficial than investing in treatment. Every penny spent on epidemic preparedness saves a lot more pennies used in medical treatment and reduces the impact of every epidemic.&rdquo;</blockquote>
