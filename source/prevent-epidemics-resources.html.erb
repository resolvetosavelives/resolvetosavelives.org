<p>Increasing global control of blood pressure from the current 14 percent to 50 percent, reducing global dietary sodium intake by 30 percent, and eliminating artificial trans fats from foods would prevent more than 100 million deaths from heart disease over the next 30 years.  The global health care savings from effective management of blood pressure alone have been estimated at $100 billion per year.</p>
