Nevertheless, this version works well with LaTeX packages like <code>minionmath</code> (TeX users, check out <code>cochineal</code> as well).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;:rotating_light: There are a good number of production issues still – if you are willing to help maintain this generation of Crimson, please let me know; I am generous with commit rights! :rotating_light:&lt;/p&gt;</td>

<h2 id="directories-and-releases">Directories and Releases</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The current directory structure will be replaced with the release of
Crimson Prime. The 2012 version will likely be kept (though not maintained) in a
separate branch.</p>

<p>The <code>Desktop Fonts</code> and <code>Web Fonts</code> directories above always contain the most up-to-date binaries, respectively.</p>

<p><code>Desktop Fonts</code> contains both OTF and TTF versions of the font. While OTF is generally regarded as the more modern and powerful format, some Windows users may prefer the rendered appearance of the TTF files, at least for screen use.</p>

<p><code>Web Fonts</code> contains subsetted (!) TTF, EOF and WOFF files. If the provided files do not meet the requirements of your website, which may well be the case, you will need to generate the webfonts yourself – using either a font editor like Fontforge or an online service such as fontsquirrel.com.</p>

<p>For TeX users, two packages are available: <a href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/crimson">Crimson</a> and <a href="https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/cochineal">Cochineal</a>, maintained by Bob Tennent and Michael Sharpe, respectively. The latter doesn't include the Semibolds, but has been extended by a ton of glyphs and adjusted to work well in math environments (a remarkable effort in its own right!).</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The font is designed in the tradition of beautiful oldstyle type, and inspired particularly by the fantastic work of people like Jan Tschichold (Sabon), Robert Slimbach (Arno, Minion) and Jonathan Hoefler (Hoefler Text). It features</p>

<ul>
  <li>six cuts (regular, semibold and bold; with a Roman and Italic each)</li>
  <li>characters for a wide range of European languages – though some are still better supported than others between different cuts</li>
  <li>spacing/kerning done by Igino Marini's spectacular <a href="http://www.ikern.com">iKern</a></li>
  <li>an unbeatable price of zero!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="contributors">Contributors</h2>
