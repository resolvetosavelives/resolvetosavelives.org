        <h1>Artificial trans fat can be eliminated by 2023</h1>

<p class="intro">Artificial  trans fat  is  a  toxic  chemical  that  increases  the  risk  of  heart  attack  
and  death.  
Globally,  artificial  trans fat  intake  is  estimated  to  cause  540,000  
deaths every year.</p>

<p>Elimination  of  artificial  trans fat  has  substantial  health  benefits.
  Eliminating  
the  addition  of  artificial  trans fats  to  foods  in  Denmark  reduced  deaths  from  
cardiovascular   disease. In   New   York   State,   people   living   in   counties   with   
artificial trans fat restrictions had a 6.2% greater decrease in hospital admissions 
for heart attacks and strokes than people in counties without restrictions.</p>

<p>Artificial   trans fat   can   be   eliminated.   
Experience   from   food   manufacturers   
shows    artificial    trans fat    can    be    eliminated    (it    may    take    2-3    years    for    
certain  foods)  and  replaced  with  healthier  alternatives  without  altering  taste  
or increasing cost.</p>

<h2>What are we doing?</h2>

<p>Resolve  to  Save  Lives
  will  work  with  local,  national,  and  global  governments  
to   help   scale   up   proven   strategies   to   reduce   and   eliminate   exposure   to   
artificial  trans fats  and  increase  availability  of  healthier  alternatives.  This  can  
be   done   through   mandatory   labeling,   limits,   and   restrictions.   The   sources   
of  trans fat  globally  are  varied  and  there  is  currently  no  systematic  effort  to  
measure  or  eliminate  its  use.</p>
<p>Resolve  to  Save  Lives  will  support  the  tracking  of  
artificial  trans fat  in  the  food  supply  and  of  people’s  exposure  to  the  chemical.  
Resolve to Save Lives’ ultimate goal is to completely eliminate the use of artificial 
trans fats throughout the world.</p>

<h2>The story of South Africa's successful elimination of trans fats</h2>


<p>Lucky Nkosi, a young mother from Johannesburg in South Africa, is only 24 years old but already weighs 120kg (265lb). Although she has been trying desperately to lose weight since her doctor warned her that her life is in danger, it remains a challenge.</p>

<div class="image-float"><a href="#"><img src="../images/woman.jpg"> Lucky Nkosi, a young mother from Johannesburg</a></div>

<p>"I can’t leave junk food because it’s the cheapest," said Nkosi, who eats fried and processed food every day.</p>

<p>South Africans are sub-Saharan Africa’s most obese people, mainly due to the rising popularity of processed food. Heart attacks, strokes and type two diabetes now kill more people than infectious diseases.</p>

<p>But Nkosi’s health situation could have been worse had the South African government not acted to limit trans fats in processed foods back in 2011.</p>

<p>"Trans fats are of particular concern because high intake is correlated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases," says Dr. Francesco Branca, Director of the WHO Department of Nutrition for Health and Development. "Trans fats are completely replaceable in foods, and mandatory national limits on industrially-produced trans fats are the most effective way to achieve elimination."</p>

<p>The trans fat content of any oils and fats cannot exceed two grams per 100 grams, according to South African legislation. Products with higher trans fats levels are prohibited from entering or being sold in the country.</p>

<p>Rebone Ntsie, Director of Nutrition at South Africa’s Department of Health (NDoH), says the legislation covers any oils and fats "either alone or as processed foods, which are intended for human consumption or assumed to be intended for human consumption, in the retail trade, catering businesses, restaurants, institutions, bakeries etcetera."</p>

<p>The regulations also require any product labelled as ‘trans fat-free’ to contain less than one gram of trans fats per 100 grams.</p>

<p>"We were not only the first African country, but also the first developing country worldwide to enact the trans fats legislation," said Ntsie.</p>

<p>South Africa’s trans fat control push started in 2008 when Dr. Ruth Rabinowitz, an opposition Member of Parliament, proposed that industrially produced trans fats in prepared foodstuffs be outlawed.</p>

<p>Initially, the NDoH considered including trans fat as part of regulations dealing also with food labelling and advertising. But, according to Ntsie, "due to the important role that reduced trans fats play in the prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), NDoH decided that trans fats regulations should stand alone."</p>

<p>Daniel Matlala, Deputy Director for Food Control at NDoH, said that South Africa drew lessons from Denmark, which had enacted similar legislation.</p>

<p>In 2009, the NDoH held extensive consultations with industry, academia and civil society, as well as a stakeholder workshop to develop a working document. This led to draft regulations, which were published for public comment in March 2010.</p>

<p>"Support for the legislation was overwhelming," said Matlala.</p>

<div class="image-float"><a href="/images/regulation-249.pdf"><img src="../images/south-africa-regulation-249.jpg"> Read South Africa's Regulation 249</a></div>


<p>The final Regulations Relating to Trans Fats in Foodstuffs – Regulation 249 – were signed into law in February 2011. Manufacturers and retailers were given six months to comply and reduce the trans fat content of their products to the required 2 grams per 100. The NDoH has been monitoring the labels of food products and it is satisfied that industry has complied.</p>

<p>"South Africa’s success with reducing trans fat is very important," said Dr. Branca of the WHO. "Restrictions on industrially-produced trans fat are often weaker in low- and middle-income countries. South Africa’s experience can help guide other countries to take action so the benefits are felt equally around the world."</p>

<p>Food science expert Nigel Sunley said that legislation was easy to introduce because the target was not big food companies but “the manufacturers of industrial fats, which is a consolidated industry with few players."</p>

<p>"There was a technological evolution in the food industry and the fat manufacturing companies managed to develop techniques of blending unsaturated and saturated fat to achieve the same functional properties previously generated [by trans fats]," he said. "The quantity of trans fats still being consumed in the country is likely very low, because next to nobody is manufacturing those fats any longer."</p>
